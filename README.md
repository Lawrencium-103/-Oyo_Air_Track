# Oyo Air Quality & Heat Tracker 🌍

### Bringing Hidden Data to Life for a Healthier Oyo State

Hi, I'm **Lawrence Oladeji**.  
I'm a Data Associate at NAKC, and in my free time, I build AI-integrated products that try to make a small dent in the universe. I'm a huge advocate for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and this project is my contribution to that mission.

## 🤷‍♂️ Why does this exist?

Let's be honest—air quality data exists, but it's usually buried in complex scientific sites or expensive reports. The average citizen in Ibadan or Ogbomosho doesn't know if the air they breathe is safe *right now*. 

I didn't like that. I believe that **monitoring our environment shouldn't be a luxury**. It should be as easy as checking the time.

Access to information is the first step to action. Without knowing there's a problem (like a heat island or a pollution hotspot), we can't push for the policies that fix them.

## 🚀 What does this actually do?

This tool democratizes access to environmental data. It's built for **0 Naira**, powered by open data, and designed to work on the phone in your pocket.

It helps us achieve three critical goals:

1.  **SDG 3 (Good Health):** It gives you real-time alerts. If the air is poor, you know to wear a mask or stay indoors. This acts as a preventative measure against respiratory illnesses.
2.  **SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities):** By visualizing pollution hotspots, we provide the "proof" needed for better urban planning and waste management discussions.
3.  **SDG 13 (Climate Action):** It visualizes heat islands, helping us understand where we need to plant more trees or change our building habits to build local climate resilience.

## 💡 How it works (The Tech)

I wanted this to be fast, beautiful, and accessible.
-   **No Backend bloat:** It's a pure static web app.
-   **Real-time Data:** Connects directly to the OpenWeatherMap API for live reading.
-   **visuals:** Uses Leaflet.js for mapping and a custom wind-layer to show you *how* the air is moving, not just *what* it is.

## 🤝 Join the Mission

This isn't just code; it's a movement. Every time you open this app, you're becoming a citizen scientist.

**Impact by the numbers:**
This tool has been used to check air quality **<span id="github-view-count">hundreds</span>** of times by concerned citizens like you.
