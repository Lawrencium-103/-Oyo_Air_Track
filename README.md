# 🌍 Oyo Air Quality & Heat Tracker

> **A Citizen Science Initiative for SDG 3, 11, and 13.**
> *Monitoring invisible threats to health and climate in Oyo State.*

## 📋 Project Overview
The **Oyo Air Quality & Heat Tracker** is a progressive web application designed to empower citizens, policymakers, and health workers with real-time environmental data. By visualizing air quality indices (AQI) and heat stress levels across 33 Local Government Areas (LGAs), we aim to reduce respiratory illnesses and heat-related mortality.

This tool is built to be **accessible everywhere**—working offline in remote areas and installable on any smartphone without an app store.

## 🎯 Impact Matrix: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
This project directly targets the following UN SDGs:

| SDG Goal | Target | How This App Contributes |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **SDG 3: Good Health & Well-being** | **3.9**: Reduce illness from air pollution. | Provides real-time health advice based on PM2.5 levels, alerting users when to stay indoors or wear masks. |
| **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities** | **11.6**: Reduce adverse environmental impact of cities. | Generates granular data on urban air quality (Ibadan metropolis vs. rural areas) to inform urban planning. |
| **SDG 13: Climate Action** | **13.3**: Improve education on climate change. | Visualizes the invisible "Heat Island Effect" and wind patterns, making climate change tangible for local communities. |

## 🚀 Key Features (MVP)
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live AQI and Weather data for all 33 Oyo LGAs.
- **Health Intelligence**: Automatic health recommendations (e.g., "Air is Poor - Sensitive groups should allow masks").
- **Offline-First (PWA)**: Works even with spotty internet connections in rural LGAs.
- **Wind Dynamics**: Visual layer showing wind speed/direction to understand pollution dispersion.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (Lightweight & Fast).
- **Mapping**: Leaflet.js & OpenStreetMap.
- **Data Source**: OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Deployment**: Zero-cost static hosting (GitHub Pages ready).

## 📱 How to Install (0 Data Cost)
1. Open the website in Chrome or Safari on your phone.
2. Tap the "Share" button (iOS) or "Menu" (Android).
3. Select **"Add to Home Screen"**.
4. The app now works like a native app!

## 🤝 Grant & Funding Usage
This MVP demonstrates technical feasibility. Grant funding will be utilized for:
1. **IoT Sensor Network**: Deploying low-cost physical sensors in market areas (Bodija, Aleshinloye) for ground-truth data validation.
2. **Community Workshops**: Training community health extension workers to use the app.
3. **SMS Integration**: Broadcasting alerts to non-smartphone users.
